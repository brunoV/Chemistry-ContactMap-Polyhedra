=head1 SYNOPSIS

    }

=attr structures

Two L<Chemistry::MacroMol> objects whose contact information you want to
calculate. Required.

=attr add_bonds_to_structures

A boolean value that sets whether to add the atom-atom contacts found
between the macromolecules for each atom pair, as a Chemistry::Bond
object of order one. It is set as 0 by default.

=attr contacts

An array reference of L<Chemistry::Bond> objects that represent the
non-covalent (order 0) bonds between atom-atom pairs that are found to
be interacting.

The contact type (Van der Waals, Ionic, Hydrogen bond or Hydrophobic),
the total contact area and the bond length are saved in the object.

See L<Chemistry::Bond> for details on how to use the bond class.

=attr residue_contacts

An array reference with residue-residue contact information. This data
structure is identical to that returned by L<Bio::Tools::Run::QCons>,
see the docs there to find out how to extract the relevant information
from it.

=attr atom_contacts

An array reference with atom-atom contact information. Identical to that
returned by L<Bio::Tools::Run::QCons>. See its doc for more information.
