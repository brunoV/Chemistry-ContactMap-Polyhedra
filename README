NAME
    Chemistry::ContactMap::Polyhedra - Calculate contacts with the Voroni
    Polyhedra method

VERSION
    version 0.100890

SYNOPSIS
        my $cmap = Chemistry::ContactMap::Polyhedra->new( structures => [ $mol1, $mol2 ] );

        foreach my $contact ( @{ $cmap->contacts } ) {

            # get the intervening atoms
            my ($atom1, $atom2) = $contact->atoms;

            say $_->name, $_->number for ($atom1, $atom2);

            say $contact->length(), $contact->attr('area'), $contact->type();
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class implements the calculation of inter-atom and inter-residue
    non-covalent contacts between macromolecules using the Voronoi Polyhedra
    Method.

    It consumes the Chemistry::ContactMap interface, interacts seamlessly
    with PerlMol, and uses Bio::Tools::Run::QCons, a Perl wrapper over
    Tsai's QCons program.

ATTRIBUTES
  structures
    Two Chemistry::MacroMol objects whose contact information you want to
    calculate. Required.

  add_bonds_to_structures
    A boolean value that sets whether to add the atom-atom contacts found
    between the macromolecules for each atom pair, as a Chemistry::Bond
    object of order one. It is set as 0 by default.

  contacts
    An array reference of Chemistry::Bond objects that represent the
    non-covalent (order 0) bonds between atom-atom pairs that are found to
    be interacting.

    The contact type (Van der Waals, Ionic, Hydrogen bond or Hydrophobic),
    the total contact area and the bond length are saved in the object.

    See Chemistry::Bond for details on how to use the bond class.

  residue_contacts
    An array reference with residue-residue contact information. This data
    structure is identical to that returned by Bio::Tools::Run::QCons, see
    the docs there to find out how to extract the relevant information from
    it.

  atom_contacts
    An array reference with atom-atom contact information. Identical to that
    returned by Bio::Tools::Run::QCons. See its doc for more information.
